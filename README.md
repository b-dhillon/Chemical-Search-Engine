# MyLittleMolecules

### Project Description:
- MyLittleMolecules is a web application. Specifically it is an eLearning minimum viable product (mvp). It is designed to teach math & science by visualizing abstract concepts using 3D models. The app in its current form focuses on carbon crystals (carbon is the only atom with 6 protons), however this framework can be applied to teach any STEM subject.
